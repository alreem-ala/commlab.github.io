# This movie is based on a freshman that is set on a specific major that he is confident with. A few months later, he is struggling with his major, not knowing how to deal with it. Later on, he decides to change his major. This is something that every liberal arts student deals with so we decided to make a movie trailer about it. 
# My website is meant to show this movie as a trailer since it is a short video.
